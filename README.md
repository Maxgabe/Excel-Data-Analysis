# Excel-Data-Analysis

## **Overview**

This repository showcases beginner-level data analysis projects using **Microsoft Excel** and **Power BI**. These projects demonstrate my growth in technical data analysis skills through hands-on practice.

The focus is on applying foundational techniques like data cleaning, organizing datasets, analyzing trends, and creating pivot tables to derive actionable insights. Additionally, I have integrated Power BI visualizations to enhance data storytelling and create interactive dashboards.

My goal is to demonstrate my progress, learn through experience, and showcase practical examples of Excel's and Power BI's capabilities in data analysis.

## **Projects**

###  **Project: <ins> Walmart Dataset Analysis** </ins>

**Description:**  

Analyzed a Walmart sales dataset sourced from Kaggle. Although the dataset was originally clean, I intentionally introduced errors to practice data cleaning skills. The project focuses on answering specific business questions related to customer behavior.

**Project Workflow:**

1.  <ins> **Understand and Organize the Dataset:** </ins>

- Structured columns for clarity and relevance.
  
- Identified the dataset's purpose based on business questions.
  
2. <ins> **Data Cleaning:** </ins>

- Addressed duplicates, inconsistencies, and incorrect formats.
  
- Standardized values, corrected typos, formatted dates, and handled missing data.
  
3. <ins> **Pivot Tables and Insights:** </ins>
- Investigate performance by regions and products.
- Explore key metrics to identify actionable insights.
- Created pivot tables answering business questions related to Customer Insights:
   
   * What is the average age and income of customers by loyalty level?
   
   * Which customer loyalty group spends the most?
   
   * How do payment methods vary among customer demographics?
- Applied the Scalper Method to generate concise, actionable insights.

4. <ins> **Power BI Visualization** </ins>

After completing the Excel analysis, I enhanced my insights by creating an interactive Power BI dashboard.

ðŸ“Š Power BI Visualizations Created:

* **KPI Card:** Displays Total Customer Spending at a glance.

* **Clustered Column Chart:** Compares Average Income & Age by Loyalty Level.

* **Pie Chart:** Shows the spending distribution across loyalty levels.

* **Stacked Bar Chart:** Visualizes payment methods by customer age & gender.

* **Pie Chart:** Displays the overall payment method distribution.

By incorporating Power BI, I transformed static insights from Excel pivot tables into dynamic, interactive visuals that allow users to explore data trends efficiently.

5. <ins> **Summarize Key Insights:** </ins>
- Highlight key takeaways and actionable recommendations.
